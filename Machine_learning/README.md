## Supervised Learning
**Task-driven** learning method. Given data in the form of examples with labels and allowing the algorithm to predict the label.</br>
Types of learning problems: 1) Classification, 2) Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Random Forests
  - Decision trees
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Artificial Neural Network
  - Suppoer Vector Machine
## Unsupervised Learning
**Data-driven** learning method and features no labels. Instead of using labels, an algorithm would be fed a lot of data and given the tools to understand the properties of the data.</br>
 Two common types of learning problems: 1) Clustering, 2) Density Estimation
  - K-means
  - Fuzzy Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering

## Reinforcement Learning
**Behavior-driven** learning method. Like we learn from mistakes, the agent do the actions and the environment give them the feedback(reward,updated state) and it fortify the actions provided by the environment. More specifically, we provide some sort of signal to the algorithm that certain behabior with a positive signal and others with a negative signal. If we reinforce the algorithm to prefer positive signal over negavie signal. The algorithm learns to make less mistakes.</br>
